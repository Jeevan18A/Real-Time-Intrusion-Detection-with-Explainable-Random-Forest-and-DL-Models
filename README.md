# Real-Time-Intrusion-Detection-with-Explainable-Random-Forest-and-DL-Models

## About:
As the complexity of cyber-attacks continues to rise, protecting computer systems
and networks has become of utmost importance. An essential function of
intrusion detection systems (IDS) is to detect and minimize possible security
breaches. However, the decision-making process of traditional IDS is opaque, and
they frequently fail to keep up with the changing threat landscape. This research
suggests a Real-Time Intrusion Detection System using Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) approaches to overcome these issues. The suggested solution
combines XAI techniques with Random Forest machine learning algorithms to
improve intrusion detection's interpretability and accuracy. The system not only
detects harmful actions but also offers transparent insights into the reasoning
behind its conclusions by leveraging explainable models like Random Forest.
Because of this transparency, threat response and decision-making are made
easier for cybersecurity analysts, who are better able to comprehend and trust the
system's outputs.
Keywords: Real-Time Intrusion Detection System, Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI), Random Forest, interpretability, accuracy, transparent
insights, reasoning, cybersecurity analysts, threat response, decisionmaking.
